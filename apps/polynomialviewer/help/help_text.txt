Real curves of polynomials.

Given a complex polynomial with real coefficients,

    f: C --> C

there is a set of curves on the domain which yield values of f(z)
which are strictly real,

    f: {curves in C} --> R

To approximate these curves, choose a small epsilon and show only
the portion of the surface for which

    abs(imag(f(z))) < epsilon

The coordinates plotted are

    ( real part of z, imaginary part of z, real part of f(z) )

The roots of f(z) are colored in red.

Click on a number field then drag left/right to modify it, or use the
keyboard.

* order: The order of the polynomial (the highest power).

* coefficient: Choose a coefficient then modify its value.

* epsilon: As described above.

* scale Re{f(z)}: Multiply the real part of f(z) by this value.

* scale color: Change the color gradient around the roots.

* resolution: The number of quads, width and height.

* plane size: (Self-explanatory.)

* plane fade: (Self-explanatory.)

* axes: Show/hide the domain axes.

Each mouse button changes the selected value at a different rate; left
button is slowest and right button is fastest.

The user interface elements (windows, input fields) were created with
the fltk library (http://www.fltk.org).
