Welcome
-------
esve is a platform-independent C++ library for building 3D and 4D
visualization applications.  There are several applications here which
demonstrate its use.

Requirements
------------
The GUI library 'fltk' is required, http://fltk.org.  esve has been
tested with fltk-1.3.3.

Compiling esve
--------------
For UNIX-style machines, run "./configure" then "make".  It is likely
that GNU make is required (often named "gmake" on non-Linux machines).

For Windows/mingw, first copy Makefile.defs.mingw to Makefile.defs
then edit Makefile.defs, giving the compiler and fltk paths.  I
recommend the Cygwin environment together with the latest mingw
compiler from mingw.org.

Where to Start
--------------
Documentation begins at documentation/index.html.

The bundled applications are in the apps/ directory; executables are
created inside their respective directories.

If you are new to esve, I recommend running hopfviewer first.  It has
in-application help and demonstrates some essentials of
four-dimensional geometry.
